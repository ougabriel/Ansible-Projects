To manage all servers within the stack using Ansible, the Nautilus DevOps team is planning to use a common sudo user among all servers. Ansible will be able to use this to perform different tasks on each server. This is not finalized yet, but the team has decided to first perform testing. The DevOps team has already installed Ansible on jump host using yum, and they now have the following requirement:


On jump host make appropriate changes so that Ansible can use james as a default ssh user for all hosts. Make changes in Ansible's default configuration only â€”please do not try to create a new config.


------------


To configure Ansible to use a default SSH user for all hosts, you can modify the Ansible configuration file. The default Ansible configuration file is usually located at `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` on the jump host. Since you want to make changes in Ansible's default configuration, you can edit this file to set the default SSH user.

Here's what you can do:

1. Open the Ansible configuration file for editing using a text editor like `nano` or `vim`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
```

2. Inside the configuration file, look for the `[defaults]` section. If it's not present, you can add it at the end of the file.

3. Add or modify the `remote_user` option under the `[defaults]` section to set the default SSH user. In this case, you want to use the user `james`:

```ini
[defaults]
remote_user = james
```

4. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

5. Now, when you use Ansible to run tasks on hosts, it will use the `james` user by default for SSH connections.

Please note that modifying the default configuration file affects all Ansible playbooks and commands run on the jump host. If you want to use different users for specific hosts or tasks, you can override the `remote_user` option in individual playbooks or inventory files.

After making these changes, you should be able to use the `james` user as the default SSH user when using Ansible to manage the servers within your stack.

Remember to follow best practices for securing user accounts, SSH keys, and permissions, and ensure that the `james` user has appropriate privileges on the target servers for the tasks you intend to perform with Ansible.
