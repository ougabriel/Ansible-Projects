One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working on to test an Ansible playbook on jump host. However, he was only able to create the inventory, and due to other priorities that came in he has to work on other tasks. Please pick up this task from where he left off and complete it. Below are more details about the task:

The inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory seems to be having some issues, please fix them. The playbook needs to be run on App Server 2 in Stratos DC, so inventory file needs to be updated accordingly.


Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and add a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 2.


Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

-------


1. **Update the Inventory File:**
   The inventory file needs to be updated to include the details of App Server 2 in the Stratos DC. Here's how you can update the inventory:

   ```ini
   [stratos_dc]
   app_server_2 ansible_host=<App Server 2 IP> ansible_user=<SSH Username> ansible_ssh_private_key_file=<Path to SSH private key>
   ```

   Replace `<App Server 2 IP>`, `<SSH Username>`, and `<Path to SSH private key>` with the appropriate values.

2. **Create the Playbook:**
   Create a playbook at `/home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Create empty file on App Server 2
     hosts: stratos_dc
     tasks:
       - name: Create empty file
         file:
           path: /tmp/file.txt
           state: touch
   ```

   This playbook defines a task that uses the Ansible `file` module to create an empty file at the specified path on the target server.

With these changes, you've updated the inventory to include App Server 2 and created a playbook to create an empty file on that server. Now, you should be able to run the playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i /home/thor/ansible/inventory /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml
```

Make sure to replace `/home/thor/ansible/inventory` with the correct path to the updated inventory file.

Please ensure that you have Ansible installed on your system and that the SSH private key you specified in the inventory has the necessary permissions to connect to App Server 2.
